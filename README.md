# Cocktails

*The app allows to view all kinds of drinks, as well as ways to prepare them. Drinks are sorted by category, and you can also find a drink by name. For each drink there is a "favorite" button, after pressing which the drink is added to the "Favorites" controller. The data in this controller is stored in the device's memory, so it can be viewed without internet access.*
